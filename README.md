# Shazam Preview

### For getting an idea of what your website will look like within the Shazam app

This little tool allows you to enter a URL or local file path which will be rendered in iframes replicating the dimensions of common devices

On top of that you can also enable/disable the initial Shazam bar that appears at the top as well as the My Shazam bar that appears at the bottom, the heights of these will simply be taken from the device iframes
